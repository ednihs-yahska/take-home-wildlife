# Take Home Wildlife Project

### What weâ€™d like you to build:
For this demo project, we would like you to create a flash card app to display samples of wildlife species.

A project boilerplate has been provided using webpack and React. You must use the boilerplate provided, but you are not required to use React. You may need to add additional files and folders to the project, but do not add any additional dependencies.

### Project details
* The application should load data from this file: (http://take-home-wildlife.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data.csv)
* The app should display each of the animals listed in the file as a flash card. The initial view of the flash card will contain the image and attribution (credit) but no other details.
* When an image is clicked, the following information will appear, identifying the species:
    * Class
    * Order
    * Family
    * Genus
    * Species
    * Common Name
* You have the freedom to style the cards as you see fit but do not add additional visual components.
* The arrangement of the cards is also at your discretion but it should work across various device widths (phones, tablets, PCs).
* There should be a visual indicator displayed while images are loading.

### Submission instructions:
* Go to the Github repo for this project (https://github.com/osuecampus/take-home-wildlife) and clone the repo locally to your machine.
* Run the application locally using `npm install` and `npm start`.
* Modify the code locally to accomplish the demo requirements.
* Push your completed project to a public repo in your own personal Github account and email us the address of the public repo so we can review it.

### Reminder:
* You cannot bring in any additional dependencies. You must use CSS, HTML, and Javascript to accomplish this project.
